# Rush-Hour-State-Space-Search
In this project, state space search algorithms were implemented to solve the game Rush Hour. Uninformed search, Uniform Cost, and informed searches Greedy-Best First Search and Algorithms A/A*. All game logic and data structures were implemented with an original design. 

To get the solution and search path, you must create a directory inside the main directory as follows:

- Output
  - Search
  - Solution
  
The search paths will be stored inside the search folder, and the solutions will be stored in the solution folder. For further documentation please refer to the deliverables pdf, as well as the inline documentation inside of the notebook.

A complete analysis of the searches are stored in the Analysis.csv file, generated automatically after every run.

### Important Notes

- You must delete the file/content of the 'Analysis.csv' file after every run.
- You must delete the content/files in the 'Search' folder after every run.

The program appends to those files, so previous runs will stay there unless it is manually deleted.
